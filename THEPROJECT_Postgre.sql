-- Title: SQL Project â€“ Film Data Analysis
-- Description:
-- This project analyzes a film rental dataset to generate insights into costs, performance, and customer behavior.
-- It involves tasks such as grouping, aggregation, filtering, and joins to extract meaningful insights from the data.

-- Task 1: Find the lowest replacement cost of films
SELECT DISTINCT MIN(replacement_cost) AS lowest_replacement_cost

    END AS price_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count
